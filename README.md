# MEC-SMSF
This is the development of the Service Migration Security Framework for MEC
The two files Source_gNB_Migration and Roaming_gNB_Migration are representing the two interfaces of the source MEC gNB and roaming MEC gNB.
The Source_gNB_Migration should be executed at the source server, while Roaming_gNB_Migration should be executed at the roaming server.
Assumption: at the begining of this program, the MES container hibernated image is available in the source server repository, available for access. 
Setup the IP addresses, PORT numbers, and PATH to the container image file of the codes in files Source_gNB_Migration and Roaming_gNB_Migration.
First execute Source_gNB_Migration
Then execute Roaming_gNB_Migration
Observe the timing values
